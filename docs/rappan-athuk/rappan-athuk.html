NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

      <p>I ran Rappan Athuk with my group over a period of two years, 2021-2023. I actually played a little bit of the dungeon years ago, and brought it out to run myself because, quite frankly, I just wanted to fight things. I was engaged in some pretty roleplay-heavy, low-combat campaigns, which were great but weren't scratching that itch, so I invited some friends to bring their cheesiest builds and let me bully them with even cheesier adversaries. I wasn't really expecting it to be as successful as it was, to be frank!</p>

      <p>Given its start as little more than a chassis for a fight ring, I glossed over a lot of the, er, finer details during this campaign. We never explicitly played anything that happened outside the dungeon, and I let the players do basically whatever they wanted in terms of buying, selling, research time, etc. As the group developed and the death rate dropped, though, it evolved into something much closer to a traditional campaign, and I'm glad that happened. It was a lot of fun.</p>

      <p>As we continue with other campaigns (more on that elsewhere on the site!), I'll write up retrospectives on how I ran this campaign, starting with a brief review and getting more and more detailed from there. This is partially for my benefit (to think about and remember the campaign, and reflect on what I can do better in the future), partially for my players' and friends' benefits (so they can learn what I changed and my reasons for doing so), and partially so that someone else who's interested in running or playing Rappan Athuk can learn about it.</p>

      <p>Enjoy! And feel free to ask questions.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>I wrote a (relatively) brief review of the 3E Rappan Athuk adventure modules, and I would like to go through to document my experiences with it, piece by piece. Linking those two levels of depth, this is going to be a longer, more DM-specific overview of the modules. I'll talk a bit more about the goals and structures of the dungeon, and what it's like to run it. Basically, what I would have found helpful to learn from another DM when I was deciding whether to run this module...</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>The Dungeon of Graves is presumed to be found somewhere deep in the wilderness. Later expansions added to the surroundings, but I didn't use those. In true evil priest fashion, the clerics of Orcus have built a graveyard to mark the location of their secret underground dungeon. The graveyard is shaped like a cross; it will be a recurring theme that the evil priests of Orcus are inexplicably also Catholic. Don't worry about it...</p>
