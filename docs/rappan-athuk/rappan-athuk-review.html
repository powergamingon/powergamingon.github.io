NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <h3 class="subheaders">Overview</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Rappan Athuk is a classic megadungeon from ye olden days (2000). Astute readers will note that that means it's actually a 3.0 publication, not 3.5. It's intended for a party of 6 players of levels 3-20, though the disconnected nature of much of the material would make it fairly easy to slot parts into an existing campaign. It was originally published by Necromancer Games, and as of 2023 is being published in a 5th Edition conversion by Frog God Games, with substantial extra material.</p>

      <p>The dungeon itself is 15 floors (plus nearly as many sub-floors), each mostly organized around a common feature, theme, or inhabitant, and all connected into a complex web. It will certainly not be fully explored by any but the most masochistically determined party. The ultimate goal is to find and destroy temples to the demon-prince Orcus, and eventually to confront Orcus himself, but there are a number of sub-plots as well as isolated challenges woven throughout the dungeon.</p>

      <p>The slogan of Necromancer Games was "3rd Edition Rules, 1st Edition Feel." The main thing they mean by this is that "running away" is a valid and even vital combat strategy. 3E and later games expect DMs to jigger things so that the party generally faces threats of an appropriate magnitude, and most combat encounters end in the deaths of the PCs' foes. Not so in Rappan Athuk; if the players wake the sleeping dragon, or ignore the signs of purple worms in the area, or even just accidentally stumble into the wrong chamber, that's on them. Character deaths are likely to be frequent, especially if the party is reckless and fails to plan ahead.</p>

      <p>If you understand that, and you want to play a brutal, combat-heavy dungeon crawl with your group, then this is a fun module to run.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">The Good</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Rappan Athuk is epic in scope and makes you feel it. By the time the players confront Orcus, they have truly earned their place in legend. Much of the dungeon, from enemy choices to "set decorations," does a very good job making this campaign feel like a struggle against terrible, cosmic evil, and that means that overcoming its challenges feels heroic, out of character as much as in.</p>

      <p>In between its battle with the very gods, Rappan Athuk does a great job weaving little sub-plots amongst the various floors of the dungeon. It's not just a straight dive down to Orcus; there's lots of side paths along the way that do a great job keeping interest, motivating exploration, and connecting disparate parts of the dungeon. These are a great way for astute players to learn about the history of the dungeon, making it feel like a living place with history and impact on the world. They also furnish satisfying climaxes for groups that aren't in it for the long haul.</p>

      <p>A lot of the encounter design is genuinely very good, especially for books published so early in 3E's life. Interesting enemy concepts and unique terrain challenges abound; I'll be keeping some of the ideas presented for my own use. Most floors have a theme or concept that makes them feel distinct and cohesive. Players get to explore different types of challenge and utilize different parts of their skill sets as they move around the dungeon, so despite being in the same location for nearly 20 character levels the encounters don't feel stagnant.</p>

      <p>The writers even put a decent amount of thought into "dungeon ecology," explaining why various situations exist and how PC actions will effect the dungeon. It'll become a lot to keep track of, but if you put in the effort the dungeon can be an ever-evolving environment to navigate. (I mostly did not put in that effort.)</p>

      <p>Broadly, the books are well-organized; every level comes with a clearly labeled map and key. Monster stats are generally given in abbreviated form in-line, making them easy to reference during play, and any monster that's not in the Monster Manual has its full stat block given in an appendix. Clues to various subplots generally reference each other and tell you clearly where to find the important information on the topic. Complicated fights come with detailed tactics suggestions. The descriptions strike a good compromise between unhelpful brevity and space-wasting fluff. Structurally speaking, the campaign makes itself fairly easy to run.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">The Bad</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Now that I've praised the encounter design, I will also admit that it sucks. Even keeping in mind the "1st Edition Feel" slogan, and modulating for the fact that Rappan Athuk was published early in 3.0 and can't be expected to keep up with the power creep that accompanies real-world player experience and a burgeoning supplement library, many of the encounters are poorly balanced.</p>

      <p>An infamous mimic inhabiting the upper levels is listed as CR 6 despite having DR 25/+5 and SR 50. On a lower level, an EL 10 area is populated with random encounters of CR 2-3 creatures (and in case you're thinking that this might just be a flavor or roleplay thing, they're specified to be crazed and fight to the death). Moreover, that EL 10 area can only be reached by traveling through an EL 12 area, and players can't leave without defeating a CR 18 opponent. The flow of challenge difficulties in some parts passes through "requiring players to be cautious and smart" and straight into "baffling."</p>

      <p>Many creatures and traps are furnished with "x doesn't work here" or "no magic effects this," presumably so that the designers can present challenges without worrying about <em>fly</em> and <em>stone shape.</em> This kind of sidestep I find insulting; good challenges should require players to utilize their resources in creative ways, not arbitrarily cut off anything that's inconvenient.</p>

      <p>Unless you have the most chill players alive, your players' power will quickly outstrip that of the enemies presented. You'll spend of lot of time redesigning encounters to be appropriately challenging and support the epic feel of the dungeon.</p>

      <p>Overall, it just doesn't feel like the writers understood how high-level 3E play actually works. They might genuinely not have, given how early the material was published, but that's not exactly an excuse. It's not just wierd CR assignments and rule-breaking fiats. As another example, those tactics discussions often rely on combat lasting <em>far</em> longer than a high-level confrontation can be expected to take. A particularly egregrious examples begins "if they are surprised..." and then details <em>six rounds</em> of buff actions. If a couple mid-level minions can delay the PCs for an entire minute, your campaign is very different from mine.</p>

      <p>Finally, that complex web of connections can make it easy for players to miss important areas or stumble into them too early. The latter is part of the intent of the dungeon; the former can cause problems, especially if the players finally find a plot-important floor only once they're many character levels above the intended difficulty. Again, be prepared to redesign when necessary to provide your players with appropriate challenges.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">The Ugly</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The copy-editing also sucks (though the 3rd installment, published in 2002, is a noticeable upgrade). Mistakes, from mislabeled map keys to miscopied monster stats, are fairly common. The dungeon layout is so complicated and poorly notated that I ended up creating a 3-dimensional flowchart to keep track of it. It's obvious that the early installments were pushed out with little time and even less budget.</p>

      <p>That said, if you actually buy the thing as I did, you're getting a good printing for an absurdly low price point. The books are sturdy and well-bound. The PDFs are clear and well OCR'd. I was frankly astounded that a 20-year-old module by a defunct publisher was still in print at such high quality.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Summary</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I and my players had a great time playing this dungeon; if you know what you're getting into, I think you will too. But the required play style and the amount of work the DM will need to put in isn't going to be right for every table. Expect a high rate of attrition, and simultaneously expect that the DM will need to redesign many encounters to keep later levels challenging. Do not expect a campaign that rewards non-combat skills and diplomatic PCs, or provides much room for light-hearted shenanigans.</p>
