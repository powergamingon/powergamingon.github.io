NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <h3 class="subheaders">Level 3A: "The Well" - Zelkor's Lair (EL 9)</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This level acts as a hub, providing a quick route from the surface to the lower levels once PCs are powerful enough. There's a few disorganized encounters and a secret door leading to the burying place of a spectre. Zelkor is an example of a Saracek-type encounter - at CR 13 and with two CR 10 iron golems flanking him, he's likely to be a serious danger to PCs who can otherwise safely navigate this level. The intimidating door trap might warn off PCs until later, but if it doesn't, running is always an option.</p>

      <p>A solid level that starts to introduce terrain challenges to fights, with PCs climbing down cliffs and crossing rivers while under attack. In a dungeon dependent mostly on demons and undead, there's some unusual encounters here as well, such as with stirges, blood-sucking insects. The only problem is that these encounters can run dry rather quickly for high-level parties; a crowd of displacer beasts, for instance, quickly becomes a drag more than it is a threat. Particularly since players can choose to go here at almost any time, this is a level where I'd recommend you be prepared to increase the encounter difficulty if your PCs arrive later than anticipated. Conveniently, 3.5 added higher-level versions of many enemies, so if that becomes necessary look for creatures like a displacer beast pack lord to sub in.</p>

      <p>Area 3A-9 leads down to level 4A. If you followed my advice in the overview, this should be changed to lead to Level 4 because the Upper Temple is a more level-appropriate challenge than the basilisk lair. This change also makes it a little easier to understand why zombies guard 3A-9, and why there's a teleportal to the Temple in 3A-10. The latter is absolutely deadly, by the way; a one-way teleportal straight to the middle of the temple is a good recipe for a TPK, and it nearly caused one with my group. You may want to give the teleportal a few visual cues to warn PCs what they're getting into - it's not clear from the descriptive text whether they can see through the portal before entering.</p>

      <p>There's also - <em>heavy sigh</em> - teleportals leading to <em>other</em> Necromancer Games products. I don't know who thought that was a good way to advertise. It's probably best to either drop them or reroute them to locations that are relevant to your campaign.</p>

      <p>Oh, and the door in room 3A-4 on the map should be labeled as leading to Level 7A. They printed this correction in the next volume.</p>

      <p>Finally, a content warning: racism. Room 3A-9 contains a group of uniquely fast and agile zombies who are inexplicably introduced with bad jamaican accents. Take a look at that one before you run it.</p>

      <p>Two tactically interesting points I want to discuss here. One, follow through on your clues! Two, the mechanics of possession.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Chekov's Gun</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If the PCs look down the Well from the surface, they'll see ominous claw marks along the stone, as if something tried to climb out. It's a terrifying observation that sets the level of danger players can expect should they choose the wrong path.</p>

      <p>There's nothing there.</p>

      <p>Why?</p>

      <p>One could argue that this is simply realism - what <em>would</em> be there, after all? Something passed by and tried to climb out eons ago, but it's not there now.</p>

      <p>D&D isn't <em>just</em> Wizard Simulator 3000 though. It's a story. And if Checkov's gun is on the wall in the first act, it had better go off by the last. It's a massive letdown for the players if you seed clues towards a big reveal and then don't follow through.</p>

      <p>Have some fun. Make it a dragon.</p>

      <p>A young adult or adult black dragon would be an appropriate challenge, and as a swamp-dweller would fit the bottom of the Well. You could also use the dracolich template for a bit of spice, or pull out a sphynx or similar creature. An adamantine chain clanks atmospherically around the creature's leg. Zelkor put it there to guard the entrance.</p>

      <p>Be a little careful with this change (or don't, if you're embracing that 1st Edition Feel). If your players get here by climbing down the well, they're vulnerable and separated, and they can't easily escape. Unless they're high enough level to put <em>fly,</em> or at least <em>levitate,</em> on the whole party, a creature of nominally appropriate CR could cause chaos by confronting them before they reach solid ground. Keep it slightly lower-level than you normally would to compensate.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>The other interesting and useful point to talk about here is Zelkor's fight. Zelkor is a spectre with a special <em>magic jar</em> ability. Similar challenges pop up a few times, actually - the writers seem to really like the spell. He also has a few iron golem companions.</p>

      <p>This fight is set up nicely. I didn't run it particularly well, in retrospect, and should have paid more attention to the <em>magic jar</em> mechanic. It's a little unclear, but I think the assumption is that, as an incorporeal undead, Zelkor doesn't have a vulnerable body to leave lying around when he uses his <em>jar.</em> Instead the party must deal with the iron golems and then with several nasty traps around the crypt until they can find the peridot gem he relies on. Zelkor injects chaos by attempting to possess them as they do so.</p>

      <p>As I understand it, Zelkor should be able to cast spells while possesing a PC, but he won't have access to material components or focuses unless the character he possessed does. If you want to use this, interesting offensive spells you could sub onto his list include <em>blindness/deafness, ennervation, touch of idiocy,</em> and <em>vampiric touch.</em></p>

      <p>(Per the usual rules, incorporeal undead don't actually need a special gem and can use almost any object as the target for a <em>magic jar.</em> For a greater challenge, you could let Zelkor make use of this, or for simplicity you could rule that his power as granted to him by Orcus requires him to use the gem gifted to him by Orcus's priests.)</p>

      <p>Fortunately, the only way to render this encounter trivial is if your party can block possession. Unfortunately, that's extremely easy. The 1st-level spell <em>protection from evil,</em> along its 3rd-level multi-target counterpart <em>magic circle against evil,</em> completely blocks any possession attempts.</p>

      <p>Yeah, savvy players will have noticed that that aspect of <em>protection</em> is massively overpowered for a 1st-level spell. Even unsavvy players are probably habitually casting this spell as one of their daily buffs, since the bonuses to AC and saves are a nice perk at low cost.</p>

      <p>It's not just <em>magic jar,</em> in fact. Keeping a <em>protection</em> spell up completely immunizes the party to any mind-control attempts, including all of the <em>dominate</em> spells, and arguably even including an illithid's mind blast.</p>

      <p>(You're welcome to disagree with me on that one. The clause that the spell protects from "enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject" is so unhelpfully vague that they addressed it in an official FAQ/errata, admitted it was confusing, and still didn't come to a helpful conclusion on it. My ruling there is based on the fact that the FAQ states that it would block <em>power word stun,</em> so stun counts as "ongoing control.")</p>

      <p>(You will also note that that adds an 8th-level spell that this 1st-level abjuration renders you completely immune to.)</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Can you tell that I don't like this spell? I don't like this spell.</p>

      <p>If your players have noticed how useful it is, you have a couple choices.</p>

      <p>One, give up on ever using enchantments on them. I mean, you should do this to <em>some</em> extent. Players deserve to have enemy attacks bounce harmlessly off their armor sometimes; it feels good to be prepared. Don't design every encounter as if the bad guys have a god's eye view on the party.</p>

      <p>Two, get used to starting combats with <em>dispel magic.</em> The <em>protection</em> spells get their power from the fact that they don't demand level-dependent checks or saves to work, but their low level does leave them vulnerable to dispelling.</p>

      <p>This is probably how to proceed with the Zelkor fight; the spectre appears in the first round to perform a targeted <em>dispel.</em> Replace one or two of his four (why???) <em>fireballs</em> with it.</p>

      <p>If you want to be particularly sneaky, replace a big chuck of his treasure with a <em>lesser rod of quicken spell,</em> or give him the feat if you've leveled him up enough that he can use it. This lets him cast the dispel and then use <em>magic jar</em> in the same round, vanishing safely into his jar before the party can respond.</p>

      <p>Still, both of those approaches leave something to be desired, as they make it a lot harder to use a very interesting part of your toolbox. The enchantment spells are the most straightforward way to set up encounters more complicated than a fireball-flinging slug fest, and it'd be nice if this 1st-level spell wasn't such a hard counter.</p>

      <p>So your third option is to house rule it. The most obvious modification is to draw from other abjuration spells such as the <em>globes of invulnerability:</em> the <em>protection</em> spells can only block spells of level equal to or lower than their own. Players who are dedicated to the cause can use <em>heighten spell</em> to defend against higher-level effects.</p>

      <p>If you do go the house-rule route, obviously talk it over with your players, and the earlier in the campaign the better. If you nerf the spells that hard, I suggest that you compensate by letting them block all enchantment (compulsion) effects. This has the nice side effect of drastically reducing the amount of time you spend tearing your hair out over the meaning of the phrase "ongoing control."</p>
