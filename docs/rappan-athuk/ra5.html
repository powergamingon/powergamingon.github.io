  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Level 4: The Upper Temple of Orcus (EL 7-10)</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Quick wierdness here. Level 4 is bundled into the second book of the series - The Middle Levels - while Level 4A is part of the first installment. If you only have the first book, you won't get to this one.</p>

      <p>As promised in the title, it's time for the first temple. These knock-down, drag-out brawls bracket the sections of the dungeon and provide a necessary sense of pacing and progress in a long, long campaign. A temple fight is a good place to wrap up if you don't want to run the full dungeon. This first temple is also a soft progress gate, as it's the main route to the lower and middle levels of the dungeon, insulating low-level characters from stumbling into an inescapable TPK.</p>

      <p>(Mostly.)</p>

      <p>There's a few unremarkable side caverns here, followed by a trek through the priests' quarters and finally the temple itself, a highly atmospheric star-shaped room containing an altar standing precariously above a pool of lava.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">The Priests' Quarters</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The party will likely pass through the priests' quarters before making it to the temple, which is an opportunity for bizarrely nonsensical dungeon design. No one in this dungeon cooks, they simply sleep in communal barracks and spend the rest of their time chanting evilly in their temples.</p>

      <p>That's pretty par for the course, though, and up to you if you want to expand this map to be a bit more of an actual living complex. The nonsensical part is the loot available to any party able to bypass the heavily-trapped chests in the barracks. These are fun little gauntlets for your rogue, and the treasure-trove that rewards them includes...</p>

      <p><em>The Book of Vile Darkness?</em></p>

      <p>What a wild thing to include in an EL 7 area. It would make sense for the Chapel or perhaps even the Lower Temple to be making use of the <em>Book,</em> but why in the world is there a major artifact sitting in a mid-level priest's wardrobe? A bit of light bedtime reading? This placement is very much a relic of that "1st Edition Feel."</p>

      <p>All that said, it's not actually that bad depending on your party. As an artifact, they can't sell the thing in any reasonable way, and unless you're running an evil campaign your party can't actually use the power bump the <em>Book</em> would potentially provide. On the other hand, be cautious if your party contains good divine spellcasters, who might flat-out die just from opening the thing and have no reason to be watching out for such powerful "traps" this early in the dungeon; either make sure the danger is tonally consistent in your campaign, heavily warn the "evil aura" the book radiates, or move it. If you're lucky, your party's divine spellcasters are neutral-aligned, in which case the extraordinarily powerful <em>Book</em> has virtually no effect whatsoever.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>As a different note, the module isn't clear what it means to "destroy" the temples, in terms of weakening Orcus. Presumably they expect you to simply kill the priessts and call it good. My own party consistently used <em>hallow</em> on the temples, which I rewarded with a display (such as a statue of Orcus falling, and nearly crushing the cleric). I found that more concrete and satisfying.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Running Large Battles</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Anyways, that's your "bizarre dungeon design" warning for the day. It's time to start talking tactics. The Upper Temple fight involves at least 20 hostile NPCs, more if anyone uses a summons. Running fights this big can be intimidating, but it also provides fantastic opportunities.</p>

      <p>I think myself decent at running these fights, but I'm only one person and I've only been doing this a few years. I'm sure that anything I say here, someone else has said earlier and better. Further, what works for one group and one GM may not be the best strategy for others. Take what you like, leave what you don't.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">The Action Economy</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>So, why run fights this large in the first place? Why 20 clerics instead of 1 demon? Well, variety is the spice of life, of course, but there is another reason.</p>

      <p>If you've been adjacent to any D&D-like TTRPG spaces for long enough, you may be familiar with the term "action economy." This refers to the restrictions on how much a character can do in their turn in the initiative order; standard actions, move actions, etc. Because of how D&D is structured, the action economy can be as important as any individual's abilities.</p>

      <p>If they're facing a single powerful enemy, a standard adventuring party gets 4-6 actions per round, while their enemy only gets 1. This allows a sufficiently prepared party to run rings around even a very powerful opponent. It also leads to escalating danger: if the party can reliably kill an opponent within 10-15 actions, then the opponent must be able to make an appreciable impression in only 1 or 2. Enemies generally accomplish this by hitting like a truck - which also means that when luck swings their way, they may be able to outright kill a PC who would otherwise have escaped unharmed.</p>

      <p>Forum discussions often call high-level play "rocket tag." One hit and you're out, so you'd better hit first.</p>

      <p>As a side note, one of the things I do like about 5th Edition is the legendary actions and lair actions that high-level enemies get, because they help balance out this action economy problem. I'll talk about that more in a later post.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>As a DM, fights with a lot of weaker enemies tip the action economy in your favor. Further, they insulate you from one-hit KOs; it matters a lot less that a player can do 500 damage when they're aiming it at Acolyte #7.</p>

      <p>There's a secret third benefit as well; with multiple types of enemies, you can make sure they have varying defenses and weaknesses that leave them vulnerable to different party members. This helps everyone feel engaged and useful, especially if your players are working at different levels of combat-optimization.</p>

      <p>Which doesn't mean you can <em>never</em> use single-enemy encounters, especially at low levels. Again, variety is the spice of life. But as my players advanced I realized that it was more and more difficult to challenge them unless they were outnumbered. By the time they were headed to the final levels, there was only one encounter that I kept at a single enemy, and if I had statted that creature out properly it would likely have been around CR 30.</p>

      <p>Anyways, we aren't there just yet. Your players are still 7th-10th level depending on their bravery:stupidity ratio; they're powerful, but we aren't quite playing rocket tag. Nevertheless, it's a good time to start talking about group tactics. Here's how I keep track of several dozen enemies without losing my mind.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Designing Enemy Groups</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Step 1: Form tactical groups.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Most prewritten modules have this done for you. Rappan Athuk doesn't list 20 separate stat blocks; it tells you Acolytes (12) and gives you a single stat block for all of them. But for particularly minion-heavy encounters you may want to break those goups down a little further. The encounter will be more interesting and memorable if there's multiple attack types happening. When I want to do this, I usually split off 2-4 members of a simple melee group and rework them as either archers or mages. A few of your "groups" are likely to actually be indviduals - leaders, scouts, and the like, with their own agendas and stat blocks.</p>

      <p>As a rough guideline, I've found it best to use one to three groups for normal combats and four to six for major ones. If you get too much bigger, you risk making the setup too complicated for you to run smoothly. But you might push it for particularly impactful moments. </p>

      <p>Each group will have a turn in the initiative order. Some people advocate "block" initiative, where all the enemies act at once followed by all players, or vice versa. If that works for you, go for it, but I personally dislike doing it that way.</p>

      <p>For one, as discussed above, "who goes first" is a massively important and even decisive factor in high-level combats. Block initiative awards that entire advantage to the same side. For two, I don't like the pacing that this creates for large battles. When I'm controlling NPCs all throughout the round, my actions and those of the players get broken up into small chunks. I don't like to be the one "in the hotseat" for a long stretch of time; I prefer to act quickly and then return focus to the players.</p>

      <p>A common reason to use block initiative is to support group tactics, like characters passing items and distracting opponents. Sometimes I find that this is actually a detriment. Tactics discussions can go on long enough when only one character's action is in question; when you add not just other characters but the interactions between them, the combat can start to drag like molasses unless you're very aggressive about moving things along.</p>

      <p>For me, giving each group an initiative count strikes a nice balance. But that one's definitely just my opinion, not advice.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Step 2: Assign roles</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>The tactical role of a group will give you a default behavior for its members. For grunt groups, that role is probably something like "move to the front" or "shoot at targets who don't enter melee." Sometimes I get a little more metagamey with this when I want to design an encounter around my players, giving groups roles like "use their touch attack to scare the bejeezus out of the heavily-armored fighter" or "use their <em>silence</em> spell to counter the bard's Inspire Courage." They may also be advancing a goal other than the PCs' deaths, such as "get to the alarm bell."</p>

      <p>When I'm upgrading a basic melee to be slightly more interesting, I just think about two different roles. One group should attempt to engage and slow down the PCs. The other should use the time this buys them to do something memorable; a particular spell, an impactful crowssbow volley, etc. Iterating on this process - adding rogue-like enemies, quick or slow enemies, etc - makes for yet more varied and complex combats.</p>

      <p>The point of identifying a role is to help you move units in an organized, purposeful fashion. It gives you a mental shortcut so you don't have to evaluate each unit's situation every round.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Step 3: Assign weapons</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Finally I decide how each group is attempting to accomplish their role; their weapon, spells, etc.</p>

      <p>This doesn't have to be a deep or complicated question. If you're looking at a simple encounter, then "melee fighters who attack with spears" might be enough. But building on this framework is how I create varied and distinct encounters. For instance, changing that to "melee fighters who use their spears to trip" will make this group much more memorable. If they have a distinctive supernatural or spell-like ability they can use, all the better; this will really make them stand out and define the flavor of the encounter. If they're spellcasters, I identify at most two or three spells that they will use.</p>

      <p>You want to have the rules for each groups' weapon available for quick reference (however you want to do that - notes, bookmarks, memory, whatever). You can always look up other actions you want them taking, especially for enemies who need to react intelligently. But by having a default action noted down and its mechanics quick to hand, you can run through the actions of lots of enemies very quickly.</p>

      <p>Of course, you might also note down other identifying mechanics for a group, like a particular defense (such as <em>blink</em> providing a miss chance) or a movement option (such as an <em>anklet of translocation</em> providing swift-action teleports). The point is to have a managable number of mechanically interesting features at your disposal.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Application: The Upper Temple Fight</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>So how does this actually play out?</p>

      <p>The Rappan Athuk writers have identified a few tactical groups for us, and even told us their tactics, so we don't have to do too much of this work ourselves. The minion groups are one set of low-level clerics and one set of mid-level; the individuals are a powerful cleric, a vrock demon, and a spectre.</p>

      <p>The clerics of Orcus by default use the domains of Death and Evil. The Death domain grants a unique and terrifying power; using a touch attack, clerics can instantly kill a creature with fewer than 1d6/level hp remaining. This is a great iconic weapon; use this once, and your players will be scrambling every time they meet a cleric of Orcus. The narration of the cleric reaching out, dark energy crackling about their hand, is evocative and can be used to link the many different servants of Orcus that PCs will meet in this dungeon, reminding players that they all serve the same god. It also forces your players to consider new tactics, as they must keep their hp above the danger threshhold or prioritize protection from death effects.</p>

      <p>In other words, that touch attack is a fantastic choice for the "iconic weapon" assignment.</p>

      <p>So, informed by the tactics suggesstions from the module, the first tactical group is the acolytes, who wade into combat with their maces and then use their death touch if a PC seems susceptible. The second is the higher-level priests. They could just be tougher versions of the first group, but we'd like to put a little more variety and distinction into this combat, so they'll hang back for the first round or two, and we'll find them an iconic spell to use before the PCs close in with them. The module suggests that one or two should use <em>silence</em> to prevent PC spellcasters from casting, while the rest use <em>hold person</em> to immobilze PCs that their allies are attacking. Once the first group starts falling, this one will wade into melee.</p>

      <p>In either case, the goal of these groups is to prevent the PCs from moving forward towards the generals. That means that they should get into threat range of as many melee PCs as possible, forcing the PCs to accept attacks of opportunity if they want to keep moving.</p>

      <p>Now we have the three individuals. The spectre is easy; it uses a touch attack, so its role can be to use its energy drain to go after a heavily-armored character. The fact that it uses energy drain instead of damage will make this touch attack a particularly harrowing and memorable choice for iconic weapon.</p>

      <p>The demon can teleport, and we haven't yet put much pressure on the "back-line" characters like wizards, so lets use it to give the players a nasty surprise by teleporting behind their lines and going after someone squishy. Frankly, at this level it doesn't even matter whether the demon actually does any damage; forcing the players to pivot quickly to mitigate an unexpected threat is enough to keep things tense and interesting. At higher levels, I might make a change (such as the feat <em>quicken spell-like ability</em>) that lets the demon teleport and attack in the same round.</p>

      <p>And, last but not least, High Priest Zehn. His role and weapon are equally simple and terrifying: he has a <em>teleport others</em> ring that he uses to attempt to drop PCs into the lava. Ouch!</p>

      <p>(Note that this isn't a real magic item, though, and details are scarce. If you want to be kinder about the random rules-bending Rappan Athuk is prone to, crack open the PHBII and make it a <em>wand of dimension shuffle</em> (which Zehn will need Use Magic Device to activate). This has the restriction that subjects must end up on solid ground, so you should also have either summoned monsters or <em>enlarge person</em>'d acolytes waiting with a readied action bull rush to shove subjects into the lava.)</p>

      <p>Zehn is unlikely to last long once the PCs identify him as a high-priority target, but he'll pull out his mace when engaged. If you'd like to make him a slightly more impressive final boss, give him the spell <em>divine power.</em></p>

      <p>This is essentially the same as the tactics the writers have given, but pared down slightly. I've ignored almost all of the contingency advice like "x does y after z dies." The Rappan Athuk writers seem convinced that combats are likely to last for ten rounds or more, and they give groups correspondingly long action sequences. It's not going to happen. You have two or three rounds to make an impression; use them wisely.</p>

      <p>It's also a good idea to assume that buffs were cast prior to combat, unless you really want to emphasize a flashy buff or a suprised enemy. If your forces are wasting rounds buffing themselves, they'll be dead before they can do anything.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Summary</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A level that consists almost entirely of a battle means an article that's mostly battle advice. In sum, when running combats with a lot of enemies, I try to keep things simple for myself, but highlight ways to make enemies distinctive. To do this, I separate the enemies into a small number of groups - usually six or fewer. For each group, I note down a role and a weapon. The role is a decision-making shortcut, a simple statement of what the group is trying to accomplish in combat. The weapon is how they accomplish that, and I note down the mechanics of the weapon for quick reference. The key simplification here is that it's one weapon, not a full character sheet - one or two spells, one combat maneuver, etc. If I want a group to be particularly memorable, I choose a weapon with unusual mechanics, striking narration, or both.</p>
