NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <div class="content">
      <p>Let's get started! My main goal here is to present information about each floor/chapter of Rappan Athuk. I'll especially be focusing on modifications I made, why I made them, and how they helped (or hindered) me in keeping the dungeon interesting and challenging for a group playing at a very high power level.</p>

      <p>By and large I'm going one floor at a time, but sometimes I'll combine a few due to length or topic. Here I'm addressing Level 0 and Level 1, just because they're both fairly short.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Level 0: The Sunken Graveyard (EL 6)</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The ground level of Rappan Athuk is a small graveyard with a stone mausoleum at one end.</p>

      <p>The Dungeon of Graves is presumed to be found somewhere deep in the wilderness. Later expansions added to the surroundings, but I didn't use those. In true evil priest fashion, the clerics of Orcus have built a graveyard to mark the location of their secret underground dungeon. The graveyard is shaped like a cross; it will be a recurring theme that the evil priests of Orcus are inexplicably also Catholic. Don't worry about it.</p>

      <p>This section is designated EL (encounter level) 6 despite the intention that parties enter the dungeon at 3rd level. This is a hurdle for new players to cross, and it's actually a pretty reasonable one: facing challenges of [party level]+3 is intended to make for a difficult encounter in which one or more PCs may die, but which is not insurrmountable. CR and EL estimates will be much fuzzier at high levels, but it's a pretty good benchmark right now.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Special gargoyles guard the entrance to the mausoleum and try to pick up and drop intruders, which is a fun fight but potentially quite punishing for 3rd-level characters. Consider subtly encouraging the presence of at least one <em>feather fall</em> in your group before they arrive.</p>

      <p>Across the graveyard is "The Well." Background information repeatedly stresses that previous adventurers warn "don't go down the Well," and there's ominous claw marks as if something tried to climb out of it. This doesn't seem to actually mean much, and the origin of the claw marks is never addressed. The background information exists mostly to convince players to avoid taking a shortcut to a much higher-level area before they're ready. This is pretty disappointing; I added a bound dragon at the bottom of the Well to make it a bit more exciting.</p>

      <p>And there's the mausoleum itself, which guards the proper entrance to the dungeon. <em>Tomb of Horrors</em> would be proud of the arbitrary cruelty of this one. The mausoleum door is locked but can be picked open fairly easily. However, if players do that, then once they enter the mausoleum will re-lock and crush them to death. Only <em>stone shape</em> or similar powers could potentially get them back out before they die. In order to safely enter the mausoleum, they first have to examine every gravestone until they find one with a secret compartment containing the key.</p>

      <p>Good Puzzle Design&trade;!</p>

      <p>Honestly, your players <em>should</em> be suspicious enough to go searching. Those willing to press forward without care aren't going to have a good time in this dungeon. To give them a fair chance you only really need two changes.</p>

      <p>One, let a rogue find the trap with a fairly low (DC 15?) search-for-traps check; perhaps don't tell them what will happen, only that they can tell the trap can be disarmed by a magical key. If your party is very high level for whatever reason, a Disable Device check should work instead of being a fiat fail; DC 40 might be appropriate.</p>

      <p>Two, the key's location should show up under a <em>detect magic</em> spell.</p>

      <p>Not much else to say about this one; it's a short introduction to the dungeon, not a full floor. But this is where you will have to decide whether to lean into the "1st Edition Feel" or give your players a couple more clues to work from.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Level 1: The Lair of the "Dung Monster" (EL 3)</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Ah yes, the "dung monster."</p>

      <p>Ok, honestly, most of the dungeon is better than these first two floors. The designers seem to have gotten the "arbitrary death traps" urge out of their systems early, and from here on the sailing is much smoother (though certainly not free of bumps). But these two encounters - the mausoleum trap and the "dung monster" - get a lot of publicity because many players don't make it further!</p>

      <p>The dung monster is a wierd DM-fiat sort of encounter based mostly on childish jokes. It's a mimic that haunts a set of pit toilets, and is, er, appropriately mutated. It's said to have gained its bizarre powers when an archmage had to go #2.</p>

      <p>Yeah, idk, do what you want with this one.</p>

      <p>The dung monster is the absolute worst of Rappan Athuk's unclear understanding of 3E rules, which is why it's a shame that it's encountered so early. It's described as a mutated super-powerful mimic. Yet despite its CR 6 designation, it has SR 50 and DR 25/+5. There's also no method given for bypassing its Regeneration 5. In some senses, it's actually harder to kill than a tarrasque!</p>

      <p>But none of that really matters much, because the actual purpose of this encounter is that the players enter a mysterious room, probably at least one of them dies, and then they run away. The stats don't matter because the outcome is prewritten.</p>

      <p>I do think it's good to keep some kind of exceptional encounter here. Rappan Athuk players should be willing to run when necessary, and now is a good time to make sure they know that. And mimics are a fantastic, classic monster that makes for a great early encounter. Whether the dung monster is the right shape for it depends mostly on how funny you think poop jokes are.</p>

      <p>The lazy option: use the stats as listed, but change the DR to 10/magic, the SR to 20, and the Regeneration to Fast Healing (which I think is what the writers intended anyways). Use 10/epic if you want to challenge a more resourceful party. It will still be very difficult for a low-level party to damage the creature, but it's more like an actual CR 6 encounter.</p>

      <p>You could also check out the advancement rules in the Monster Manual and jack up a regular mimic to about 12 HD. However, I prefer to keep the special acid and engulfment abilities, as they make for a more flavorful and terrifying encounter.</p>

      <p>Besides some nice if inexplicable set pieces (the priests have left the players a poisoned tarot deck to find), the main plot on this floor is the most classic low-level D&D monster: rats! In this case, the 1d3 dire rats come with wererat leaders, and it's a fun ambush encounter with multiple types of combatants and a barricade/cover challenge. It starts with a wererat pretending to be a beautiful woman, lost and scared and asking for help. This will probably fool your players for approximately a millisecond, but it's fun.</p>

      <p>And that's about it, as level 1 is appropriately the most straightforward level of the dungeon.</p>
