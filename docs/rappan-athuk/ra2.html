NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

      <p>Welcome back. Level 2 <s>is</s> <em>was</em> rather short, but then I decided it was a good place to discuss some of the peculiarities of the dungeon's design.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Level 2: Marthek's Place and Ambro's Base (EL 6)</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Level 2 is pretty solid, but it might be the least coherent of any in Rappan Athuk. They couldn't even come up with a funny name for it. In addition to the titular barbarian and ogre, there's ghouls and an animated broom sweeping a storeroom, and a locked door with a super-powerful skeleton blackguard named Saracek behind it. The door is intended to resist characters until they're more powerful, but (un)lucky rogues might manage to pick the lock anyways, in which case Saracek will probably kill them.</p>

      <p>It's laid out almost as a circle (or square, rather), which has the nice property of encouraging encounters to run together instead of completely firewalling the various inhabitants from each other. The book provides info on wandering monster checks and on the circumstances in which each group might notice and join a fight. Making use of these will help bring the level to life.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">A Small Box with a TPK Inside</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Saracek is an example of a favored theme in Rappan Athuk, a former hero who died and was corrupted (not necessarily in that order), and who now serves Orcus as an undead monster. He's also an example of a common structure, a well-hidden or blocked encounter that's much higher level than the surrounding area.</p>

      <p>Most of these are unlikely to be found except by divination, which is reasonable as stumbling on them early is a death sentence. They're frequent subjects of the rumors the modules give out, so use those to control when and how you want your players looking for them.</p>

      <p>Do so carefully. Saracek is fairly easy to run away from, but many such encounters are inescapable kill boxes for a weaker party, and there's rarely a good way for the players to gauge if they're strong enough to face whatever's inside.</p>

      <div>

      <img src="saracek.png" alt="A black-and-white drawing of an armored skeleton, holding a sword and reach forward towards the viewer. It stands next to a fancy chair, and other skeletons are partially visible sprawling on the ground beside it." style="float:right; border: 3px #cccccc solid; width: 45%">

      <p>I think this is also a relic of that "1st Edition Feel," where you're <em>supposed</em> to say things like "I'm going to take several hours and carefully search the entire corridor." 3E discourages that sort of approach by asking for a skill check every [unit], wasting your time out-of-character as well as in. Obviously most parties abstract this to some extent - as written a single search check arguably only covers a 5-foot square! - but you still have a norm that characters probably won't do things the players would find super boring. Either encourage this play stye, or seed other clues via rumors and divinations.</p>

      <br>

      <p>On the other hand, if the party avoids a TPK, these caches provide enormous treasure rewards that could be unbalancing at low levels. Beating Saracek early nets the party a <em>+2 evil greatsword of wounding,</em> a <em>+2 holy large shield of blinding,</em> and a <em>tome of understanding,</em> at a time when their average equipment value is a few thousand gp at best. Later caches even provide artifacts such as the <em>shadowstaff.</em></p>

      <br>

      <p>(True to form, the writers have neglected to mention what kind of shield it is or what bonus the <em>tome</em> provides, and I have no idea what "holy" means applied to a shield. The "large" designation is a 3.0 vs. 3.5 thing, though. I suggest making the shield a (large/heavy) metal one, and using the magic weapon property of bestowing negative levels on wielders of the opposing alignment. The <em>tome</em> should be either <em>+1</em> or <em>+2</em> depending on how generous you're feeling.)</p>

      <br>

      <p>With Saracek, as with many inhabitants of the Dungeon of Graves, the most likely route for an early kill is if your party has a cleric with a strong turning ability... and it probably does, because the players signed up for a campaign called <em>Dungeon of Graves.</em> Most interesting undead in this dungeon get +4 turn resistance. You may want to habitually shove that to +6 or even +8 for boss enemies.</p>

      </div>

      <p>All of which is to say, these can be incredibly fun encounters and great ways to incorporate the stories and secrets of the dungeon, but make sure you lead players to them with care and deliberation.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">And a little more fighting...</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Of the other encounters on this level, I'd just like to highlight Marthek. He can be a good fight - as a level 6 barbarian capable of raging, he's a major threat to the party. But his stat block is a little careless, and hhe doesn't fight to the death. If the PCs attempt to find out why they might be able to help him and even get him on their side. Telegraph this hard if you want your players to pick up on it.</p>

      <p>Marthek's stat block seems to think he's wielding his greatclub one-handed, and his tactics note makes no mention of his Power Attack feat. My suggestion: downgrade his club to +1 (a +2 weapon is a bit overkill for this level), but have him fight two-handed. This increases his damage modifier to +10 (+13 when raging). Then make strong use of that Power Attack (and remember that a power attack bonus is doubled when fighting two-handed!); attack at at least -2 for a +4 damage bonus.</p>

      <p>These changes will be absolutely deadly to a party that is likely 4th level - he might knock down a squishy wizard with a single hit. To compensate, have the enraged barbarian focus on armed and aggressive targets.</p>

      <p>The text also includes a spike on which Marthek can attempt to impale opponents, leaving them dangling for later (I assume the implication is that he'll eat them). If your party isn't squeamish, you can actually use this to save battered PCs, since it does less damage on average than the greatclub.</p>

      <p>If most of the frontline combatants are below half health, or if a PC goes down, Marthek should drop his club and attempt to pick up and impale the closest attacker. Replace his Improved Unarmed Strike feat with Improved Grapple so that this doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, but he'll be moving around to do it so PCs will get extra attacks on him. Smart PCs will try to pick up his club before he can come back for it. This process should be sufficiently gory to scare the players, but reduces Marthek's damage output enough that they'll probably get him to half health (and hence convince him to flee and cower) before they all die outright.</p>

      <p>Once Marthek is wounded and attempts to flee, his rantings might cause PCs to pause before finishing the job. But as written they probably can't actually break the curse on him until they're much higher level. Instead, attempts to talk with the cowering barbarian (after he tries showering them with green slime) should make it clear that he's cursed and fighting against his will. So long as he's wounded, Marthek won't pursue the PCs, and they can return later. They may try to net themselves some insurance on that, such as by jamming his door shut.</p>
