NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <div class="content">
      <p>The dragons are more literal than usual today...</p>

      <p>The celebration (or mourning) at the end of <em>The Champion's Belt</em> comes to an abrupt end when the black dragon Ilthane arrives in Diamond Lake to take revenge on the adventurers who foiled her plans back in <em>Encounter at Blackwall Keep</em>. The party must act quickly to save their former home from destruction. Once the dust has settled, their ally Allustan is discovered to be missing. Acting as an amateur archaeologist, he discovered a teleportal in The Whispering Cairn that the party (presumably) missed the first time they were here, and is now trapped in a tomb a thousand times more deadly than the first...</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Initial Impressions</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Honestly, this adventure gets such a solid "yep, dungeon!" rating from me that it's almost hard to say anything about it. You want to explore a dungeon? Here's a dungeon!</p>

      <p>It's really fun how this dungeon ties together almost every thread the previous adventures have been setting up. Back to the Whispering Cairn, Allustan is here, Ilthane is back, the Ebon Triad looms overhead... this module wraps up the first half of the adventure path into a nice neat package and opens nicely into the second, the blessing of the deceased Wind Duke providing a powerful symbol of the destiny that awaits the PCs.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, it's motivated almost solely by the assumption that the players will go "oh? dungeon? dungeon time!" and open the door you put in front of them. In the previous article, I discussed that the only reason for the PCs to return to Diamond Lake is to deliver a letter - a letter which they might not even find if they fail a Search check! Perhaps we can safely assume that, once arrived, the PCs do go into the tomb to find Allustan (the adventure path is assuming that you're mostly a good party and that you like Allustan), but even in that case there's no particiular reason to keep exploring once they find him. In fact, there's plenty of reasons <em>not</em> to: a good party might feel they shouldn't be arbitrarily looting the tomb of a hero of old, their home has recently been decimated and needs help, and they know for a fact that the Triad's plans are in motion. They may be uninterested in wasting their time fighting through to the end of the tomb, in which case they'll miss the <em>Rod of Seven Parts</em> and won't get Icosiol's blessing.</p>

      <p>Unmotivated as it is, this is a pretty fun dungeon. It really feels like a tomb designed to foil intruders, with vicious traps and time-wasting false paths everywhere. By the time we got to the end, my players had developed a pavlovian fear response to doors. There's actually very little combat for a 3E dungeon, which feels appropriate in a trap-focused tomb. Indeed, several of the inhabitants are true <em>inhabitants</em> who have goals and priorities that have nothing to do with the PCs, and who don't need to be fought. These factors combine to make the tomb fun and dynamic to navigate.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Traps & Trickery</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>It took me a long time to decide what to write about this module. Most of my retrospectives are examining what I think the module does well or poorly, or about how I deal with aspects that are challenging to run from the DM side of things. This is just a very middle-of-the-road, solidly fun dungeon crawl and I don't know what else to say about it.</p>

      <p>But it's perhaps worthwhile to talk about the traps and tricks that the dungeon incorporates. While once a dominant part of dungeoneering, traps have sort of fallen by the wayside as D&D has progressed. This module is a decent example of how to continue incorporating them.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Why <em>have</em> traps dwindled in importance through the years? I would identify two related reasons.</p>

      <p>One is the thief problem - the hacker problem, if you're in a cyberpunk game. As it appears in 3E, <em>only</em> the rogue can interact with traps in the intended way. Even if you have a different skill monkey in the party, only rogues (and a very few related, non-core classes) can find any magical trap or a trap with a Search DC above 20. It's just a fiat fail, which is very unusual in 3E. Thus, unlike combats or conversations, traps are a one-person show. Like the hacker, who frequently ends up being placed into their own little hacker minigame that no one else can participate in, rogues in the 3E paradigm have no replacement and don't need allies.</p>

      <p>The second problem is abstraction. In earlier editions of D&D traps were often concrete things. There's a tripwire here, a pressure plate there, is the mysterious glowing portal safe to enter or a death sentence? Everyone at the table could interact with them because everyone could reason about how physical systems interact. The ubiquitous 10-foot pole can be waved in front of you to trigger tripwires and pressure plates; ominous wall slots can be jammed with caltrops; mysteriously clean patches of ground can be avoided.</p>

      <p>3E isn't really <em>about</em> the player reasoning about physical interactions; that's what skill checks are for. They change the game from the player's skill to the character's. Conversations can be summed up with a Diplomacy check, lore retrieved with a Knowledge check, and traps defeated via Disable Device. In many ways this is completely fine - not everyone wants their in-character life to depend on their real-world eloquence - but it also results in some friction. in this case, traps are no longer being treated as objects; instead, they're just bundles of stats, which makes them much less fun to interact with.</p>

      <p>This gets significantly worse with magical traps, which the game makes no effort to explain at all. What's going on with rogues finding and disabling magical traps? Are they seeing glints of magic power that no one else can? Have they been taught to carefully manipulate the threads of a spell to unravel it?</p>

      <p>IDK. Roll Disable Device.</p>

      <p>Again, I don't think this sucks in all situations. It's great to have systems which let us interact with a fantasy world without becoming experts in it. I don't make my players tell me how they're planning to break someone's guard before they make an attack roll.</p>

      <p>But I <em>can</em> tell them how their mace crushes the dragon's armored scales or how they barely deflect the owlbear's claws, because the monsters my players are fighting have physical descriptions. Traps don't get that.</p>

      <p>These two problems - that rogues are the only players allowed to interact with traps, and that interacting with traps is abstracted in a way that makes it hard to describe or reason about - end up making traps less and less fun to have in your dungeons.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>But Icosiol's Tomb <em>does</em> use a lot of traps, and my party had fun with them, so let's look at what it does to make that work.</p>

      <p>In many cases, it gives us a mechanical description of the trap. First it cues players to be wary via obvious dangers, like mysterious spikes that they can assume <em>something</em> is going to try to push them onto. Second, it gives a description of how each of its traps works, mentioning holes in the walls and describing the magical auras that <em>detect magic</em> might reveal. It explicitly accepts non-Disable Device destructions of the trap triggers where relevant. It still presents some pretty arbitrary magical-trigger traps, though. Third, it actively describes the physical action of the trap, giving the DM something to work with when explaining what's just happened.</p>

      <p>It's also pretty consistent about its traps. There are false doors <em>everywhere</em> in this dungeon (though some of the false doors aren't even traps, just ways to waste time and let other dangers do the work). It's not just that one pillar in a room might collapse on you - all of them are rigged that way, so encountering one warns you to avoid the others. Traps are frustrating when "get the rogue up here and roll Search" becomes a boring, time-consuming toll you must pay to safely navigate; being able to reason about where traps might be placed is massively helpful to their fun factor.</p>

      <p>Lastly, while these traps are impactful, they mostly aren't devastating to a high-level party. They have low save DCs, moderate damage, slow-acting mechanisms, or all of the above. This works around the restrictions of 3E's trap system; because the traps aren't death sentences, most parties won't be driven into slow, paranoid, grindingly boring playstyles to avoid them.</p>

      <p>I should probably also mention the multiple "factions" found in this dungeon. The whacky Earl of Coalchester can be persuaded to warn PCs about the path ahead; a paranoid shadow spider doesn't want to kill the party, it just wants its hoard to be safe; an intelligent ghoul is happy to cooperate if it means reaching the surface world. These are fun! It's good dungeon design.</p>
