NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <h3 class="subheaders">Adventure Summary</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>In this adventure the PCs finally begin to learn about the coming of the eponymous Age of Worms. There's a lot to learn after the previous module brought more questions than answers. The majority of it is a straighforward scenario consisting almost entirely of a dungeon crawl.</p>

      <p>After learning about the presence of the Ebon Triad, the PCs descend into the mines around Diamond Lake to confront the cult. They must find a way to get past the mine workers and guards at the surface (who are largely innocent bystanders), after which the rest of the adventure is a single massive dungeon - the Triad's temple. Each of the three branches of the cult controls a subsection which presents challenges themed around one of the evil gods: for Hextor barracks and a "battle-temple" arena, for Vecna a magical labyrinth constructed by the god himself during his mortal life, and for Erythnul a series of rough and difficult-to-navigate caves. Just when the players think they're finally safe, the bloodshed in the temple triggers the emergence of a terrible monster called the Ebon Aspect.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>I'd rather not begin two reviews in a row with complaints - but unfortunately The Three Faces of Evil is widely considered the worst of the 12 installments of Age of Worms. It's brutally difficult in ways which were probably unintended, and more prone to errors or continuity breaks than other parts of the adventure path. <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2h8t4?TFoE-corrections">Here's a thread providing some common notes and cleanups for it.</a></p>

      <p>As an interesting tidbit, the author of The Three Faces of Evil is Mike Mearls, who would be hired by Wizards of the Coast a few years later and become a lead designer for the 4th and 5th Editions. One hopes he learned a few things in the intervening time! Or perhaps it's just that the details aren't his strong suit.</p>

      <p>Anyways, in sum, this adventure is an introductory-style mini-dungeon-crawl which has been bloated far too large. The core problem is that D&D has a strong logistical element, in 3E based around recovering abilities during a long rest, yet there's nowhere to rest in the dungeon.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>I think DMs should discuss this more often than they seem to, because it's an enormous element of encounter balancing. Encounters that are easy at the start of the day become harrowing at its end. If the PCs are assured they can rest frequently, they can freely use their most powerful spells and abilities, ending encounters quickly. If they need to settle in for the long haul, they must take risks to preserve those powers for later. And if they think they'll rest soon but are unexpectedly prevented from doing so, they may waste their resources too quickly and end up in deep trouble.</p>

      <p>This also effects the balance between classes - generically, magic-users have long-rest-based recovery while nonmagical characters have few, if any, time-limited resources. Facing one or two encounters in a day, the wizard can pull out all the stops, but the fighter will be able to keep going long after the rest of the party has been reduced to cantrips and quarterstaffs.</p>

      <p>(Of course, there are plenty of ways for smart players to upset this. But in general.)</p>

      <p>When you describe this adventure's dungeon, you can see the bones of a simple, four-room setup. There's an arena fight in the barracks of the followers of Hextor, a puzzle-solving section in the Labyrinth of Vecna, and a more complex fight through difficult terrain in the Caves of Erythnul. Finally the players must return for a boss fight in the central location. This would be a decent little introduction to D&D, almost like a tutorial dungeon or something you'd see in the Adventurer's League.</p>

      <p>But The Three Faces of Evil needs to take the players through three entire character levels. Each of areas is stretched with extra battles - yet no rest points have been added, forcing PCs to continue fighting through far more encounters than their resources can cover.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Three main issues here.</p>

      <p>First, the temple is underground, accessible only via an elevator in a mineshaft. PCs need to sneak or bribe their way in. The mine managers and guards are connected to the temple, and they'll presumably be alerted once the attack is discovered. That means it's nearly impossible to leave and return.</p>

      <p>Second, the temple consists entirely of interconnected, intelligent, communicating adversaries, meaning that it beggars belief that the PCs could rage through a single section and then pause for rest unmolested.</p>

      <p>Third, many encounters involve crowds of low-level adversaries; they're cult fanatics lead by a few more powerful characters. At this level of play, PCs are unlikely to have access to significant area damage, forcing them to spend time and resources on each enemy individually. Once <em>fireball</em> is on the table you can throw in as many minion hordes as you want without making much of a difference, but right now the long fights are yet another way to grind down the PC's limited resources.</p>

      <p>These design choices, any of which would be fine on its own, compound to make an adventure far more difficult than the sum of its parts. The first encounter won't kill your party, nor will the second. But the sixth? What about the tenth?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Go easy on 'em</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Just this once.</p>

      <p>Normally with my group of players I'm talking about how to make things harder! And there are a few changes I made for that, for instance by leveling up a few of the 1st-level mooks. But for once I was more concerned with giving my players a break. How to do that?</p>

      <p>First, when they met Balabar Smenk he helped supply them for their fight against the Triad. I included a caster level 9 scroll of <em>rope trick,</em> a spell that creates an invisible dimensional pocket. At a duration of 1 hour/level, my 3rd-level party couldn't use this spell to get an entire night's sleep in. Careful use of the scroll allows them to effectively vanish for a single long rest, letting them get that crucial recovery in when they need it. My players have invested heavily in the Use Magic Device skill, so it's feasible for them to use a scroll that's higher caster level than they are. If your party hasn't invested in UMD, it would be simple to create a single-use wondrous item for the same purpose, though I'm not aware of one existing in print.</p>

      <p>If they haven't gotten these on their own, Smenk can also help get the party a few <em>cure</em> potions or a wand to supplement their healing. Otherwise the cleric's four or five spells will run dry very quickly...</p>

      <p>Second, I pushed the players towards the Caves and Labyrinth when they were low on resources. Unlike the Battle-Temple of Hextor, these sections of the temple have secretive inhabitants and strong terrain barriers, making it harder for the other branches of the Triad to investigate. For instance, players who learn the secrets of the Labyrinth could conceivably rest in one of its hidden rooms without being discovered.</p>

      <p>With a rest or two accounted for and a bit of extra healing in their pockets, the dungeon is no longer a death trap. It's still a grueling test of endurance! But the players have a fair chance.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Other Impressions</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Even ignoring all that, the dungeon is of rather meh design - there's not much in the way of interesting structure, just three subsections to enter one after the other. Unlike the Whispering Cairn, there's little thought put into this as a place where the inhabitants obstensibly live, move around, and have a history. In parts it's prone to the "enemies were posed in their idle animation waiting for the PCs to arrive" issue, like the Faceless One being found mid-experiment in his lab even though the labyrinth structure ought to give him plenty of warning.</p>

      <p>That said, the individual encounters are great, with a lot of unique visuals, challenges, and structures. I said in my retrospective on The Whispering Cairn that encounter design was a strength of this adventure path, and I'm maintaining that. Taking a look at how they structure combats, enemy groups, and the response tactics of organized enemy groups is well worth it.</p>

      <p>The standout is the multi-phase encounters in the grimlock caverns. The writers were brave enough to go 3D with their cave design, and the result is complicated but well worth the effort. Stalagmites provide a lot of cover to work around, and a multi-level area lets archers harass the PCs as they're forced to navigate climbing up and down cliffs. If clever players find a way to the archer's balcony directly, they must navigate tight tunnels and precarious rope bridges instead. I do wish they'd managed to be a little more clear on the structure - maps of this area are lacking. But a careful read is well worth the effort.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the labyrinth of Vecna and the temple beyond it are <em>cool as hell,</em> visuals this time though the labyrinth fight is great in its own right. This place really was built by Vecna and responds differently to his worshippers (including PCs, which is unlikely but nice to include). There's eyes in the walls. Ghosts in the pillars. It's great. Go beat your players over the head with the cosmic ramifications of the mess they've gotten themselves into.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>While, as mentioned above, the details and continuity have a few issues, I will praise the general layout of the module. It gives good information on how the temple inhabitants work together and respond to the PCs' presence, and generally uses clearly labeled summaries/sidebars instead of trapping key information under specific room entries. Running such a sprawling organization is a lot of work, but the reward is worth it.</p>

      <p>But relatedly, my main advice for running this module should probably be about the organization of the introduction. It's... confusing. As far as I can tell, the goal is to provide a link to the previous module, The Whispering Cairn, while also allowing groups to pick up the adventure path here (which makes sense for a serial publication). But instead of clearly labeling different possible approaches, the introduction provides information all at once. It ends up giving the impression that PCs should be simultaneously working with three or four different factions, each of which has a convoluted reason to suddenly be interested in the Triad.</p>

      <p>Don't take this section as a foolproof description of the state of affairs at the start of the adventure. Just use whatever follows most naturally from the previous part of your campaign, and let the other factions stay out. Likely that means Smenk following up with whatever the PCs learned from Filge; Allustan has no reason to be involved at this point. The information regarding his investment in affairs is probably intended mostly for players who didn't run Whispering Cairn and thus who have no connection to Filge or Smenk.</p>

      <p>The module also fails to follow up on The Whispering Cairn's promise of information on the possibility that Filge temporarily allies with - and likely betrays - the PCs. Alas. You'll have to improvise if you want to include him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Final Thoughts</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Final thoughts here won't be suprising. There's some fantastic set pieces here, but they're tied together awkwardly, and if you run the adventure without preparing you risk catching your players in a punishing slog that's more likely to end with a whimper than a bang. (If you don't believe me yet, you can grab your popcorn and start reading through <a href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2gck0&page=1?Age-of-Worms-Obituaries">this thread of character obituaries.</a> Three Faces is <em>vastly</em> overrepresented, even accounting for the fact that many groups won't play the full campaign.)</p>

      <p>Now go forth and beat up evil cultists.</p>
