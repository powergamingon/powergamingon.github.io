NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <h3 class="subheaders">Adventure Summary</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Last adventure, the PCs discovered that they were being targeted for assassination by a man named Loris Raknian. To strike back against their enemy, they become gladiators and infiltrate the Champion's Games, which are organized by Raknian. They have opportunities to ally with others that Raknian has wronged and will discover a plot far greater than just their own deaths - for Raknian plans to turn the whole of the Games into a deadly sacrifice to Kyuss, ushering in the first days of the Age of Worms. The PCs must act fast to save thousand of lives, and avoid getting arrested in the process!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Initial Impressions</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>There's a lot to like about this adventure. The gladiator portions give you unusual opportunities for fun, flashy, nonlethal fights against enemies with class levels. The conspiracy portions are delightfully open-ended, requiring the PCs to take the initiative. And, as I've repeatedly praised in this adventure path, the writers absolutely refuse to pull their punches; the players will have to be clever and resourceful, or thousands of innocent lives will be lost.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>On the flipside, that wide-open conspiracy isn't necessarily the easiest thing to run. A lot of the detail that the module carefully presents may never come up, and at the same time it's not hard for the players to choose to investigate places where detail is scarce. Unlike the more straightforward dungeon crawls, this adventure requires the DM to do a lot of decision-making and improvising of material. If the PCs don't keep things quiet the entire city government could plausibly get involved in the fallout, an eventuality for which the module provides no guidance whatsoever. There's only so much a monthly magazine publication can do to cover the wide-ranging implications of the PCs' involvement in this conspiracy, but I think that it could have spent less space on gladiator stat blocks and more on helping DMs run the large web of possible events.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Player Initiative</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Champion’s Belt is a bit of an outlier in this otherwise straightforward series. It’s significantly more player-driven than most of the other adventures. If your party isn’t paying attention it’s quite possible for them to simply be blindsided by the end of the world.</p>

      <p>Specifically, the events of the module are perfectly happy to proceed without any PC involvement whatsoever, and there’s no visible doom clock. There’s no a priori reason for the PCs to believe that the Games are relevant to the quest; they’re simply a convenient excuse to get close to Raknian. If they get caught up in the excitement of playing gladiators and don’t make time to investigate, the first sign of danger comes when the fully formed ulgurstasta erupts from the ground beneath their feet.</p>

      <p>I think that this is a strength of the module, but it does mean that your players must be used to taking initiative, and that you must make sure you give them opportunities to act on their own. If you simply proceed through the listed Events, reading some block text and then telling the PCs that their next combat is scheduled for 2pm, you aren’t giving them the chance to explore.</p>

      <p>If your players don't jump on opportunities to investigate, you might want to highlight it when they have free time and ask what they're doing with that time, reminding them that .</p>

      <p>As with the prison sequence in the previous module, kudos to the writers for not pulling their punches. If the PCs fail here, thousands of people will die. No second chances. Similarly, there’s no convenient “off switch” for the Apostolic Scrolls that are creating the ulgurstasta; the straightforward solutions like disintegrate are still (just barely) out of reach of the 10th-level party. Your PCs are now strong and resourceful. If they can’t come up with anything, tough luck.</p>

      <p>It’s great! These mid-levels are a fantastic time to challenge your PCs like this; they have a lot of resources at their disposal, but they aren’t gods yet. You can throw curveballs at them and expect them to find creative, unexpected solutions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Off the Tracks</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Rather than a mechanical discussion here, I’ve got some improvisation to discuss. How do you bend prewritten material to fit your table?<p>

      <p>The module assumes that the PCs will discuss the Apostolic Scrolls with Eligos. He tells them that Raknian’s possession of the scrolls is dangerous (though he doesn’t know the “blood of a champion” bit - if you think your group needs a heavy-handed shove in the right direction, giving Eligos that bit of lore should do it). Then he finds Celeste and Ekaym to sponsor the PCs in the Games, kicking off the subplot of searching for Ekaym’s sister, who was killed by Raknian.</p>

      <p>Just one problem: my players don’t like Eligos.<p>

      <p>This is partly my fault. D&D often suffers from Protagonist Syndrome, with NPCs immediately ride-or-die for the PCs. I didn’t want to be sending my party straight from one genially helpful wizard guide to another, so I played Eligos as significantly less interested in them than Allustan was - he’s doing a favor for his former friend, but he’s a busy and important man.<p>

      <p>A few of my players responded in kind, and while the group hasn’t made an enemy of Eligos, they haven’t confided in him, considering him a neutral information broker rather than a potential ally. They didn’t mention the Apostolic Scrolls to him (and failed a research check to learn about the scrolls themselves), and they refused his offer to help them find a sponsor for the Games.</p>

      <p>Woof! This gives me a lot of improvisation to do in the first half of this module.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>First, the sponsor. I gave my players a couple options. One was to try to recruit a different noble ally, likely one of the people they rescued from the doppelgangers’ conspiracy. In that case I’d have made them help cover the cost of getting a team into the prestigious games last-minute. The other option was to research existing teams and find one to replace. I made a quick list of sponsors of some of the low-ranked teams listed in the module. My PCs ended up impressing the sponsor of Varmint Patrol, and after a showy duel with her master of the guard convinced her to sponsor them instead.</p>

      <p>The key here is that every option should have both upsides and downsides. They can accept Eligos' help, but they don't want to be indebted to him. They can ask an ally, but they'll have to fork over some cash.</p> 

      <p>When trying to quickly offer alternate paths to my players, I prioritize thinking of a simple complications each path will have, so that there's no obvious best option.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Second, Ekaym. You could hit two birds with one stone and just reinsert him as the sponsor that the PCs find - perhaps he's advertising to find a team. But when improvising I prefer to avoid this type of "all paths lead to the same destination" approach. You can pull this kind of stunt when you need to, but overuse will eventually make it clear to the players that their choices don't actually matter.</p>

      <p>As a general rule, since the PCs are the ones saving the day, the villains win when they're not around. If they don't get involved in a plotline, think about how the situation might worsen.</p>

      <p>So I figured it would be more fun if, unable to find a gladiator team to work with, Ekaym became desperate enough to investigate himself and is now in danger. I did cut Celeste; she seems to be here mostly as an easter egg for anyone who’s run the Shackled City adventure path, and can wait to be introduced until her next appearance (or be cut entirely).</p>

      <p>With that in mind, I decided that, within the first day or two of the Games, Ekaym got into the tunnels under the arena while looking for Lahaka, but was injured by the ghasts and caught by Bozal Zahol. Paralyzed by ghoul fever, he’s been tossed into the refuse pit at area 24/21 (this is a bit of an accelerated timeline for the normal sickness rules; perhaps they’re particularly noxious ghasts). His Dexterity score has reached 0, so the PCs will need ability score healing to help him. I'm rolling Con damage for him each night, starting at 10, meaning that he'll likely die on the third or fourth night if he's not found.</p>

      <p>If the PCs find and aid Ekaym, he explains what’s happening and attempts to help them find his sister. At this point he’s nearly hysterical with fear and grief, and if that doesn’t convince them to help he’ll promise to pay them everything he owns and then some (which isn’t actually that much by adventurer standards - if your players really want to extort a dying man, a 10th-level NPC’s gear value is supposed to be 16,000 gp, so let’s assume that a non-adventurer has about the same tied up in various assets, and the PCs only get that much if they start selling his business for him).</p>

      <p>Ekaym will try to help the PCs, but he’s not great in combat. He can give them a brief sketch of the caves around the Coenoby and a few of the rooms in the Shrine of Kyuss level, and a description of Bozal Zahol. They’ll be best off hiding him somewhere safe (perhaps the Titan’s House in area 18).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>The other route to Lahaka is that she had admired Auric, which is what led to Raknian killing her. If you want to cut Ekaym entirely, you could decide that she had actually progressed to trysting with Auric before being caught, and that the gladiator is suspicious of Raknian for her murder. In this case, he attempts to recruit the PCs to help him essentially the same way that Ekaym did, explaining that as reigning champion there are too many eyes on him for him to investigate.</p>

      <p>(It’s unclear how this tidbit is supposed to come up otherwise - one of the frustrating aspects of Age of Worms is that it tends to give you big paragraphs of lore-dumps at the start of each adventure, much of which is completely opaque to the PCs. It’s nice for giving you background to improvise answers to unexpected questions, but annoying to have all this knowledge and no way of sharing it!)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Third, Eligos. At the end of this adventure, Eligos is discovered to have been killed by Raknian’s people, prompting the PCs to bring his notes back to Allustan and discover Ilthane assaulting Diamond Lake.</p>

      <p>(Though only with a DC 20 Search check. It should be trivial for a party of this level, but it’s incredibly bad form to hinge your entire continuing plot on one skill check. These weaknesses in the investigative/linking structure are the main ongoing issue with Age of Worms as written, I believe.)</p>

      <p>Not only is this a bit railroady (is there any way for the PCs to prevent the assassination? What do you do if they don’t think Allustan can help them any more and they don’t want to take the notes to him?), it’s harder to work in with my party mistrusting Eligos. They’ll check in with him eventually because he’s still helping them with research, but they have no urgency to do so after the Games, and presumably his death will be discovered by others before long.</p>

      <p>As a way for the players to be more active participants, I decided that Raknian needs his bodyguard Okoral to succesfully assassinate a powerful warmage. If the PCs manage to kill or disable Okoral before the 4th night of the games, Eligos will be able to fight off the assassins and survive.</p>

      <p>Then I wanted both a reason for the PCs to check in with Eligos and a reason for them to urgently return to Diamond Lake. I had Eligos scry Ilthane, learn of her location, and send an urgent note to the PCs - but, with the PCs stuck inside the Coenoby, the message doesn't reach them. Their sponsor won't pass on the note until after the Games, since they can't leave without forfeiting. Additionally, communication between the gladiators and outside parties might be highly restricted to prevent colluding on rigged matches.</p>

      <p>So, soon after the PCs emerge victorious (hopefully), their sponsor gives them the note, which warns them that Eligos has found Ilthane near Diamond Lake, cannot contact Allustan, and fears the worst. It asks them to come to him to collect the remaining notes that he’s made, but the PCs may find him dead.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>It's worth noting that, as the PCs are supposed to reach 10th level in this adventure, they very easily have access to the 5th-level cleric spell <em>raise dead.</em> It's frankly strange that the module doesn't address this. They may decide it’s worth resurrecting Eligos immediately (of course, he’s supposed to be resurrected by Manzorian later in the adventure path, but your players don’t know that). Throw a wrench into the works by deciding that Eligos was killed by a death effect, which means <em>raise dead</em> won’t work, and that he is too proud to return via <em>reincarnate.</em></p>

      <p>Even so, your players may be willing to get someone to cast <em>resurrection</em> for them, especially if they got a lot of money betting, and they can certainly find a sufficiently high-level character while they’re in the Free City. They may also try <em>speak with dead</em> (up to you whether Eligos can identify Okoral as his murderer). There’s no reason to prevent them from doing this. If the PCs resurrect him, or if he survived the assasination, Eligos leaves to consult with Manzorian, sending the PCs to check on Ilthane’s presence in Diamond Lake. His death actually has very little effect overall, if you're not relying on it to get the party back to Allustan.</p>

      <p>(If the PCs never learned about Ilthane during the 3rd adventure, then Eligos can instead attempt to contact Allustan about the notes and learn that he's missing.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Final note - I also made the vagabond in the cells in area 7 the same street preacher the PCs meet in The Hall of Harsh Reflections. As the ulgurstasta is created, his visions have been showing him worms growing under the earth around the arena, and Bozal’s people picked him up before he could bring any attention to them. I found this a nice bit of continuity to throw in.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>We're not even done improvsing yet. That's just the decisions I made prior to running the module, based on points that I knew in advance would be problems. I ended up making other changes to respond to my players and flesh out the surrounding NPCs.</p>

      <p>This is already a long page, so I'll just list some aspects of the adventure that you might need to adapt.
        <ul>
          <li>Raknian's mansion is on the grounds of the Arena, but gets no description at all beyond that. PCs trying to investigate the man's actions will almost certainly think of sneaking out of the Coenoby to check his living quarters. Set up his bedroom or study with alarms and a few clues to his fear of death and his relationship with Lahaka.</li>

          <li>The Free City is surely prepared for disturbances caused by unruly gladiators. If fights break out in a public area, mid-level city guards equipped with scrolls of <em>dimension door,</em> <em>hold monster,</em> and <em>dispel magic</em> should respond within a few minutes.</li>

          <li>If the ulgurstasta breaks out, the rulers of the city will be very interested in speaking to the adventurers who stop it. Cooperating may take time and expose more civilians to the wrath of the secrecy-obsessed Ebon Triad, but refusing might land the PCs straight back in prison - at a much more high-security location this time.</li>

          <li>If the PCs publicly stop the ulgustasta, they might become national (or at least metropolitan) celebrities. Whoever sponsored them in the games now has a vested interest in keeping that relationship positive and may help or equip the PCs. But doing so may make them targets of agents of Kyuss.</li>

          <li>Be ready to decide how spells like <em>zone of truth</em> are used by the judicial system, should the PCs get arrested or publicly confront Raknian.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Final Thoughts</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Final thoughts: a great adventure that needed an extra page or two of space. If you can keep track of all the moving parts, this will be an extremely memorable adventure for your players. Fights with chariot-mounted archers, stealth and social challenges to avoid the Coenoby guards, thousands of lives endangered as the ulgustasta emerges... this is an explosive introduction to the apocalyptic scale of the second half of the adventure path. But I really wish the writers had spent a little less space on fights that may never happen, and a little more on the wider picture. If you're not comfortable planning for or improvising a society's response to the PC's actions, the module doesn't give you much support.</p>
