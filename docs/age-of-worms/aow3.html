NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <h3 class="subheaders">Adventure Summary</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The horizon widens as the adventure finally pushes beyond the bounds of Diamond Lake. The players have learned of the apocalyptic plans of the Ebon Triad, and it's time to take the fight to the enemy.</p>

      <p>The wizard Allustan, having played a small role in the previous adventures, invites the PCs to be his bodyguards as he brings diplomatic information to nearby Blackwall Keep. His ulterior motive is to learn more about their involvement in recent events in Diamond Lake, but it's a fortunate choice, because the group arrives to find the keep under siege by lizardfolk from the nearby marshes. Imploring the PCs to help, Allustan returns to Diamond Lake to bring aid.</p>

      <p>From here, the adventure can take several paths. The PCs must disrupt the attack on the Keep or help defend it until Allustan returns. Afterwards, they travel to the lizardfolk village, where they learn what provoked the attack and perhaps find evidence of the oncoming Worms. They must resolve the conflict between the Keep and the lizardfolk, and defend both the Keep and the lizardfolk from infestations at the hearts of their respective societies.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Initial Impressions</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I think this is a very solid adventure. It does a lot of what I would hope for from an "overworld" adventure, and is a great change of pace from the dungeon crawls. While the writing is obviously tilted towards a violent solution, the PCs can approach the conflict between the Keep and the lizardfolk in a number of ways. There's a lot of characters with different knowledge and motivations, most of whom have entirely sympathetic reasons to be doing what they're doing. Because of those motivations, any information the PCs manage to discover can be a vital weapon, whether in actual battle or in a more diplomatic approach. And the PCs aren't insulated from their mistakes; both the soldiers of the Keep and the lizardfolk are in grave danger. If the party is callous or incurious, people die, and for good measure they might come back as worm-zombies to make the PCs' jobs even harder.</p>

      <p>This is a general strength of the writing in Age of Worms; it's willing to let the PCs experience consequences. Here, people will die if the PCs don't get involved. It's likely that some will die even if they do everything right. It keeps their choices impactful and drives home the stakes at play.</p>

      <p>(It's also <em>consistent,</em> for the most part, about applying those consequences. Sometimes games can provide inconsistent incentives, like places where the players should slow down and take their time followed unexpectedly by events that are on tight timers. This isn't unrealistic, but it can leave your players feeling uncertain, frustrated that behaviour that was rewarded once got them punished the next time. In Age of Worms there's a few principles that are essentially always a good idea: care about people, gather information, and don't waste time. I appreciate this consistency.)</p>

      <p>The presence of allies for the PCs is also a great change of pace. The party likely can't face the lizardfolk force alone; they need both allies and good tactics. Even my heavily-optimized group wasn't able to get away with heroic risk-taking. The fight at Blackwall Keep is an unusual opportunity, well-described, and great fun.</p>

      <p>It's also just pretty decently written - not nearly as confusing as some of the information segments in the previous module. You should be able to quickly get a clear idea of what each of the NPCs is doing in this adventure, and even though it doesn't provide much explicit instruction on a diplomatic route I found it very easy to run one.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>The main weakness of this adventure is the introduction with Allustan. It's almost <em>too</em> well-motivated, and can feel heavy-handed even if you play it well. In the previous adventure the PCs likely found information pointing them towards the Mistmarshes. Then Allustan turns up to say "all right, time to travel to the next plot point which is conveniently also in the Mistmarshes." Then he teleports out (literally) as soon as something interesting happens, because he's still higher-level than the PCs and can't overshadow them in the fight. The whole thing feels quite artificial.</p>

      <p>It doesn't help that the PCs are likely to learn about the presence of Ilthane, but have no way of actually finding her until she turns up again three modules from now. Players don't tend to be fantastic at delayed gratification, and might expect that they can strike out into the Mistmarshes to find the illusive dragon. If you shut down their attempts just to send them to the next plot point, the campaign could start to feel extremely railroad-y.</p>

      <p>At the same time, Allustan has to get involved here or it'll be difficult to have him send the characters to Eligos next module. I modified the Three Faces of Evil handouts to be less clear about the marsh/lizardfolk connection, which I think helped a bit.</p>

      <p>Without attempting to provide a full rewrite, I'll just encourage anyone running this adventure to be prepared for flexibility. If the PCs try to persuade Allustan to stay, he could do so instead of scolding them for cowardice - as he's a research wizard, you have plenty of justification for restricting his spell list a bit if you feel you need to, to prevent him from single-handedly solving the problem. Give him a few enchantments and abjurations, stear clear of the evocations and transmutations, and he'll be a powerful but not overwhelming ally. If the PCs hang around the Keep and risk discovering the Kyuss zombie in the cellar "before" they're supposed to, let them. Be ready to support attempts to track down the dragon and potentially offer a clue, like an abandoned lair with some of the slow worm potions. Locating Ilthane can also be made part of the reason the party goes to Eligos, as the powerful wizard could possibly attempt to <em>scry</em> the dragon for them or find records of her in his library.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Unknown Danger</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>On a completely different note, this is likely the PCs' first encounter with threatening Kyuss worms, and that means it's a doozy. If someone gets infected, the time to save them is measured in rounds. The PCs aren't high-level enough to have tons of resources in their pockets, there's been no reason for them to walk around with spells like <em>remove disease</em> prepared, and the number of players who bother to put ranks into Heal is tiny. (And unless your players are familiar with how magic and the Monster Manual deal with parasite-type enemies, it may not even occur to them that these are options! Allustan or Filge could have volunteered this information if the party was consulting them about the worms.)</p>

      <p>I don't think this is a bad thing; they'll have to learn eventually. But it's worth being aware of as a DM. If you're not sure your players are prepared, I suggest that Blackwall Keep should have a few relevant potions in their infirmary supplies (<em>remove disease</em> if you're feeling generous, <em>neutralize poison</em> if you're not). It makes sense for a military outpost to have such items, and it rewards players for thinking and asking for help. The mad scramble to get the potion to the victim(s) in time will be plenty nail-biting to drive the lesson home.</p>

      <p>If you do want to hit the brakes for the sake of an unprepared party, you could replace the Spawn of Kyuss's Create Spawn ability with the effect of the slow worm described on pg. 33; acting on order of days, it leaves plenty of time for the party to figure out a solution. But I wouldn't do so for my own group, as my players are quite resourceful.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, if you want to grant the Spawn of Kyuss a little more survivability, grab the Favored Spawn of Kyuss template from the Ecology of Kyuss supplement in the Overload. At 29 hp and AC 10, the Spawn is as fragile as it is deadly, and competent players may action-economy it to death before it can do anything. Giving it an area attack and damage reduction helps a lot.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Side Notes</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The map of Blackwall Keep might be harder to get your hands on than any other part of the adventure path. It was originally printed in the magazine on a fold-out poster map. The poster maps mostly didn't make it into scans of the magazines, and are likely to be long gone from used copies of the physical prints. Here's a quick description.</p>

      <p>Blackwall Keep is on top of a hill, with a single road leaving it. The Keep is about 50 feet on a side. Separate from the Keep but near it is a burned-out barn. Around the hill and blocking the road the defenders have set up chevaux de frise (wooden spikes pointing outwards to hamper movement). The hill is mostly bare of trees, but below it is a sparse forest where the lizardfolk camps shelter.</p>

      <p>Here's a link to an archived version of the only scan of the original map I've been able to find online: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230808114841/https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2060/2063594013_bd009d0165.jpg">Blackwall Keep Poster Map.</a></p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Additionally and somewhat interestingly, the adventure contains an intersex character - the druid Hishka (though it uses the outdated term hermaphrodite). Hishka gets referred to with they/them/theirs as well. Apparently the lizardfolk subscribe to one of those belief systems where gender-variant people are spiritually significant. I'm not going to pretend that this is a shining beacon of representation, either for intersex people or for shamanic religions, but it's worth mentioning so you can decide how to approach this information.</p>

    <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Final Thoughts</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Final thoughts: extremely fun adventure with a lot of opportunities for the PCs to define their own paths. Information is presented clearly and thoroughly. The only major drawback is the potential to descend into an overt railroad at the beginning and end, particularly if you attempt to enforce the timeline of information-reveals the module assumes. Also, have a list of NPC names ready, because neither the Keep's guards nor the lizardfolk warriors have them.</p>
