NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <div class="content">
      <p>Having gathered evidence of the Ebon Triad's activities, the PCs head to the big city to consult with one of Allustan's colleagues, a high-level wizard named Eligos. But the cult catches up with them quickly as a group of doppelgangers hired by the Triad attempts to frame the PCs for murder. They must track down the assassins to root out a conspiracy threatening the city and discover the identity of the cult's representative. Unbeknownst to the PCs, the doppelgangers have already infiltrated their ranks...</p>
    </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Initial Impressions</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>On the good side, once again, kudos to the writers for refusing to pull their punches. If the PCs aren't quick on the uptake, both innocent civilians and their allies might die in this adventure. If they mess up and get themselves arrested like the doppelgangers want, there's no easy path out; no conviently loose bars or unwary guards. They should be able to find a way to escape, but they're going to have to work for it.</p>

      <p>The adventure is also just <em>stylish.</em> It takes full advantage of the increasing flexibility of a mid-level party, throwing in iconic enemies, water combats, all sorts of ways to distinguish this adventure mechanically from the previous ones. The pièce de résistance, of course, is that the doppelgangers have (hopefully) already kidnapped and replaced one of the PCs. This leads to a beautifully tense fight in a hall of mirrors, where the doppelgangers impersonate kidnapped PCs and force the party to scramble to tell apart friend from foe.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>There is one noticeable problem with this adventure: its investigation structure is <em>incredibly</em> fragile. A doppelganger frames one of the PCs for attacking the innkeeper hosting them, and tracking down the shapeshifter leads them to the group's warehouse hideout. But there's only one way for the players to find this out. They must run to the rescue when a commotion breaks out in the taproom, then a fight begins, then the PCs must kill or apprehend the doppelganger Elaxan in the melee before he can get away, and finally they must find his keychain and search for the meaning of the symbol on it.</p>

      <p>That's a lot of things that have to go right, and there's <em>no</em> other clues available (unless the PCs get arrested, in which case they skip the investigation and get delivered directly to the doppelgangers). What happens if the PCs tell you they have better things to do than hang around in their inn's taproom, or they don't want to get involved in a bar fight, or they fail to kill Elaxan before he gets away? And if the doppelgangers want to lead the PCs to their stronghold, why does their plan involve one of them getting killed?</p>

      <p>The same thing comes up following the drow from the doppelganger's hideout to their own. The party is supposed to fight the drow, notice some distinctive mold on their boots, and then spend several hours tracking them down through the sewers. If your group has any reason to think that sounds like a difficult proposition, you'll have to improvise.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Shoring Up the Investigations</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Fortunately, it's not hard to seed a few more clues into the "investigation." I simply had the doppelganger Elaxan take out a room in the Crooked House, and altered the fight in the taproom to have Elaxan run immediately instead of staying to start a fight. He passes the PCs as they enter (they might apprehend him if they're already suspicious) before climbing out his window to escape. This offers a clue that isn't time dependent; any time the players are suspicious, they can search the rooms of the Crooked House and find it. Elaxan has left an empty flask, a potion of <em>alter self</em> (to mislead the players about the doppelgangers' nature), an open window, and, crumpled near the bed as if it fell from his pocket, a note written on Sodden-Hold-branded stationery with brief descriptions of the PCs. Like the, er, dead person's arm in the owlbear encounter from The Whispering Cairn, this leaves us with an unimaginative one-path "investigation," but at least it's one that the PCs are almost guaranteed to find.</p>

      <p>I also turned Elaxan's keychain, buried in a pouch, into an amulet around his neck. If the PCs save Tarquin or find way to use <em>speak with dead,</em> he can describe it to them. Finally, had the PCs passed some Spot checks (which mine did not), they would have noticed that one of the people fleeing the taproom bore an uncanny resemblance to the framed PC, and perhaps followed or attacked Elaxan just like the original adventure intended.</p>

      <p>All this is shored up by the fact that, if things go right for you, by this time one of the PCs is secretly a doppelganger as well. You can feed them clues (such as "search the rooms" or "ask about the octopus symbol") if the party gets stuck.</p>

      <p>In tracking down the mind flayer, I ended up utilizing the left-behind <em>mind gems</em> as clues, allowing the PCs to get some more information from the embedded minds.</p>

      <p>I make no pretensions that this turns the adventure into a foolproof mystery, but it worked out all right with my group.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3 class="subheaders">Oops</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I try to talk about mechanical considerations in these posts; the point is to reflect on the choices I make as a DM/GM, explain and examine them. So let's talk about how I accidentally almost TPK'd my party here.</p>

      <p>Oops?</p>

      <p>I've <em>purposefully</em> almost TPK'd ("total party kill)" before. I have a lovingly adversarial relationship with this group of players; they find character builds that let them paralyze all opponents and then inflict a squillion damage in a single attack, and I try to stop them. But this is the first time I've done it by accident.</p>

      <p>The fight in question is, of course, the Hall of Mirrors battle with the disguised doppelgangers. The fault is that I layered on too many situational challenges, taking an encounter of nominally-appropriate CR and placing it into a context which made it much harder.</p>

      <p>The fault is also in our dice; a few very, <em>very</em> unlucky rolls didn't help matters.</p>

      <p>First, of course, there's the disguised doppelganger, which immediately ups the difficulty of the encounter. Not only is one of the PCs missing, the doppelganger impersonating them gets the drop on the party. As I've written about before, at higher levels the course of combat can be almost entirely decided by who acts first, and the doppelgangers by default have rogue levels, which make them even better at taking advantage of the surprise.</p>

      <p>Without really thinking about it I added a few more difficulties on top of the prewritten one. Like much of this adventure, I found the Hall of Mirrors fight stylish but nonsensical. As mentioned, one of the PCs has hopefully been replaced by a doppelganger during their downtime in the city. That PC is in the mirror-room tied to a chair. Alongside them are doppelgangers disguised as each of the other party members.</p>

      <p>So, just to be clear, the enemy combatants are starting this encounter <em>tied up.</em> If they immediately slip their bonds as the module suggests, it'll be pretty obvious which ones are fakes, ending the psychological part of the battle before we've managed to make an impact with it. The PCs have already encountered shapeshifting, so your players aren't going to be particularly phased by the mere existence of their doubles.</p>

      <p>Just like with the inciting incident of the adventure, where it's unclear why the doppelgangers would send one of their number to die just so the PCs know to come find them, why should this group of skilled assassins put themselves at such a big disadvantage if they don't need to?</p>

      <p>The obvious answer is that they're trying to buy time. The doubles act might not delay the start of combat for very long, but it's long enough for some type of timed effect to start. So I decided that the reason for this whole act was that the doppelgangers had set up a poison-gas trap, and were hoping to delay the PCs long enough for the poison's secondary effect to hinder them.</p>

      <p>(In D&D, poisons all work in a standard, somewhat strange, way; they have an immediate primary effect and a secondary effect one minute later. Usually the secondary effect is stronger, though not always.)</p>

      <p>With that in mind, I chose to set up an Insanity Mist trap at the entrance to the Hall of Mirrors. At CR 8, this is an appropriately-leveled challenge for the party, and the fact that it does Wisdom damage means it'll help enhance the confusion caused by the appearance of the doubles.</p>

      <p>Finally, I tailored this fight significantly more than I usually would, especially at low-mid levels. Again, this is a group of skilled assassins which has had the PCs under surveillance for some time. They'll have ways to counteract most of the group's "signature moves," and they won't waste time on attacks the PCs are good at defending against. The main form this took was an entanglement to tie up the extremely tanky fighter, a <em>silence</em> spell to hamstring the spellcasters and the bard, and a <em>dispel psionics</em> to disrupt the buff-heavy psionicist.</p>

      <p>(<em>Silence</em> is a great tool to keep in your back pocket, by the way - it can massively disrupt magic-reliant parties without a save. Don't pull it out too often, though, as working around it can get frustrating fast.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="box">
    <div class="content">
      <p>So what actually <em>happened?</em></p>

      <p>First, I didn't give my players a fair fight against the trap; the PC who I replaced was their rogue, leaving them effectively completely helpless against the gas. This is also where the poor luck came in, as everyone vulnerable to the mist failed at least one of their saves (it's only DC 15, so I wasn't expecting this), failed a check to notice the mist, and only got alerted to the danger when the bard rolled secondary damage high enough to cause them to pass straight out! The party had no source of ability damage healing, forcing them to leave the bard on the ground and hope for the best. Between said bard and the spy in their midst, the party went into combat already down 2 out of 5 members.</p>

      <p>Then my targeting worked beautifully, as the warforged juggernaut also failed a save and got taken out entirely by an <em>ectoplasmic cocoon.</em> By the time the combat started in earnest, there were only two PCs standing and a doppelganger rogue with a <em>swift invisibility</em> wand between them.</p>

      <p>'Twasn't pretty, and one of those PCs even hit the ground at negative hp near the end of the fight. But they got out.</p>

      <p>So what would I do differently?</p>

      <p>Honestly, not too much. Poor luck did genuinely play a major role in this meltdown, and if I ran it again the outcome might be quite different. But the trap should have been decreased in CR; depending on your players, you could simply decrease the poison's damage, or specify that the gas is visible/detectable and bank on the doppelgangers being equally "endangered" to keep the PCs in the room.</p>

      <p>(That second one also depends on an evaluation of your players. In a high-optimization group, I generally can't rely on getting my players to waste time. They can take out an enemy in seconds and they're fully aware that their opponents can do the same, so they don't take chances. If I were overtly gassing the room, I wouldn't be setting up a challenge where they attempt to understand who their allies are and break them out of the room in time, or decide that it's worth taking on the danger to get everyone out. I'd be setting up a solid 50/50 chance that they immediately fireball the whole place. They very nearly did anyways! That's not fair to the player who graciously allowed me to tie up their character and stick them in the middle of danger.)</p>

      <p>But I genuinely shouldn't have rewritten the doppelgangers with as many class levels as I gave them. I relied on my players' skill to get them through a battle with creatures that averaged at 3 or more levels higher than them, including level adjustment, and I was pulling out my own tricks to give them well-considered builds that would stand up to a great deal of damage. I should have left this at a single high-level doppelganger psion to use the <em>cocoon</em> and <em>dispel</em> (which would also have spread these attacks over a longer time) then written the others with lower CRs, letting the diminished party deal with them more quickly.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Final Thoughts</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Final thoughts: an adventure with more style than substance, but a whole lot of style. The set pieces in this adventure are great. You have excellent chances to engage with and challenge your players; putting in the thought to tailor this adventure to your party is well worth it. Even just the locations are often striking and memorable. But a lot of the pieces fit together poorly when you look closer, and it's equally worth spending some thought on shoring up the links between the cool-as-hell individual encounters.</p>
