NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

    <div class="content">
      <p>Quick wierdness here. Level 4 is bundled into the second book of the series - The Middle Levels - while Level 4A is part of the first installment. If you're looking for 4, don't worry, your book isn't missing a section.</p>

      <p>The Basilisk Caverns are one of the least remarkable sections of the dungeon, but they're also one of the better examples of megadungeon design. Rather than attempting to build a plot through scripted encounters, it lays out a web of creatures and the interactions between them. If you're paying attention, this floor will be slightly different each time players pass through, shaping exploration </p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Leveling Up and Down</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>That said, unlike in the more classic dungeon-crawl formula where specific character level isn't quite as important, the balancing on this level is a little finicky. That's due to the presence of the eponymous basilisks. They're slow and poorly-armored, and their bite damage is tiny. The save DC against their gaze attack is also low - it's only DC 13 - but failure means permanent petrification.</p>

      <p>This is one of the lowest-level examples of a "save or die" situation in D&D. At higher levels your players will see more of these, usually in the form of death effects, but they'll also have more defences against them (and <em>ressurection</em> if those don't pan out). Here, a streak of poor fortune could potentially TPK the party, and they won't have access to <em>stone to flesh</em> until they're much higher level. On the other hand, at higher levels the low save DC and access to protective spells will render the basilisk's danger negligable.</p>

      <p>Hence, keeping this area an appropriate challenge requires your players to rely on their own smarts, not just on their stats. The slow basilisks and their short-range gaze attack can be outmaneuvered by characters who are keeping their distance and using strategies like turning away or wearing blindfolds. You might want to encourage strategies like avoiding fights and skirting around enemies. Instead of dropping into initative order as soon as the encounter table turns up a basilisk, warn your players that they see one and ask how they're responding.</p>

      <p>Earlier versions of D&D had more mechanics for this type of thing, where the third edition leaned into more aggressive monsters who attack on sight and fight to the death. In keeping with Necromancer Games' "1st Edition Feel," you might want to look into those mechanics or modern analogues. For instance, rolling a random encounter might include rolling the "encounter distance," the distance at which the party spots the basilisks, or it might indicate that the party encounters tracks or other warnings instead of an immediate enemy. They also included morale and retreats; for instance, the basilisks might flee if they take a certain amount of damage. Pay attention also to the discussions of how the ecosystem responds to adventurer disruptions; for example, Rappan Athuk frequently mentions that clearing out large predators means that the place will be overrun by rats the next time the party visits. At your discretion - in particular, depending on how long you want the campaign to last - the rats might then be followed by different predators.</p>

      <p>Encouraging this type of gameplay will really help out this level, along with similar exploration areas in the dungeon. They let the dungeon feel like a real, living place, one which will always be interesting to explore and rediscover, and which will never be completely safe or predictable.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, 3E characters <em>do</em> level up in a drastic fashion. If your players explore elsewhere and don't arrive at this level until later, they may be powerful enough for the basilisks to be more boring than intimidating. I previously mentioned switching this level's entrances with those of Level 3 in order to better balance the baslisks with likely player level; see the DM's overview for information on doing that.</p>

      <p>But if that fails, don't be afraid to level up your monsters to keep the tension! 3.5 conveniently offers upgraded CR 12 basilisks, and you could look for other creatures to substitute as well, such as ropers or hydras. The key for this level is going to be disorganized low-intelligence monsters, so that the players can move around the level without provoking a coordinated assault.</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Summary</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A level that consists almost entirely of a battle means an article that's mostly battle advice. In sum, when running combats with a lot of enemies, I try to keep things simple for myself, but highlight ways to make enemies distinctive. To do this, I separate the enemies into a small number of groups - usually six or fewer. For each group, I note down a role and a weapon. The role is a decision-making shortcut, a simple statement of what the group is trying to accomplish in combat. The weapon is how they accomplish that, and I note down the mechanics of the weapon for quick reference. The key simplification here is that it's one weapon, not a full character sheet - one or two spells, one combat maneuver, etc. If I want a group to be particularly memorable, I choose a weapon with unusual mechanics, striking narration, or both.</p>
