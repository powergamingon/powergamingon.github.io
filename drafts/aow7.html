NOTE: For now, if you use this page in a subfolder, you'll need to add "../" in front of symbolic links (style.css, dragon-vibe-green.gif, any others you add), or iterate that for subsubfolders, etc.

There's a conflict between trying to link to pages in a way that works during offline editing/testing, and doing it in a way that works online. Going straight to the root ("/style.css") doesn't work unless you've put the github repository in your computer's root (why have you done that?), and a hardcoded link ("https://www....") only retrieves the online, published version of the file.

      <p>The dragons are more literal than usual today...</p>

      <p>The celebration (or mourning) at the end of <em>The Champion's Belt</em> comes to an abrupt end when the black dragon Ilthane arrives in Diamond Lake to take revenge on the adventurers who foiled her plans back in <em>Encounter at Blackwall Keep</em>. The party must act quickly to save their former home from destruction. Once the dust has settled, their ally Allustan is discovered to be missing. Acting as an amateur archaeologist, he discovered a teleportal in The Whispering Cairn that the party (presumably) missed the first time they were here, and is now trapped in a tomb a thousand times more deadly than the first...</p>

    <h3 class="subheaders">Initial Impressions</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Ooh, this is a fun one.</p>

      <p>Ok, as a <em>dungeon</em> the Spire of Long Shadows isn't spectacular. The layout is extremely simple, and unless your players choose to delve into the mid-level tunnels, and you oblige by fleshing out and improvising that section, there's not much in the way of rewarding exploration. But the combats? Now <em>those</em> are good!</p>

      <p>This is one of the only times I've run a prewritten, high level adventure that really felt like the writers actually understood high level play. The inhabitants of this dungeon range from dangerous to deadly. The various encounters on the ground floor are the first time that I've <em>ever</em> run a prewritten combat above EL 10 without changing a single thing. It wasn't just challenging for my players, it was almost deadly. Before a few tactically good turns managed to turn the tide in their favor they were considering whether it was time to retreat.</p>

      <p>(Caveat: this is true in part because I was generous about the sounds of combat alerting the various enemies and drawing them out of their default rooms. Obviously this is a realistic way to run intelligent cohabitating creatures, but if you want to keep things less deadly you could simply keep the doors shut.)</p>

      <p>It took me a long time to decide what to write about this module. Most of my retrospectives are examining what I think the module does well or poorly, or about how I deal with aspects that are challenging to run from the DM side of things. This is just a very middle-of-the-road, solidly fun dungeon crawl and I don't know what else to say about it.</p>

      <p>But it's perhaps worthwhile to talk about the traps and tricks that the dungeon incorporates. While once a dominant part of dungeoneering, traps have sort of fallen by the wayside as D&D has progressed. This module is a decent example of how to continue incorporating them.</p>
